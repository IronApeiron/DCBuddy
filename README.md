# Noteworthy Features

- Channel Battle tracker. Have you missed a channel battle and want to know the results without logging into the game? Sure, get DCBuddy to keep you in the know!

# Backend

- Managed with a PostgreSQL database using the Npgsql API.
- Uses Microsoft Azure to enable Microsoft's ClickOnce deployment for easy patch deployment.

#### Please note that the online capabilities are no longer functional, since I made the decision to end all services with the announcement of Drift City's closure :(
DCPal's code has not been adjusted enough to run smoothly, but it is not worth altering for a game that no longer exists. ####
