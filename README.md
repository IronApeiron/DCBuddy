# DCPal
A toolkit for Drift City (http://driftcity.gamescampus.com).

# Noteworthy Features
- CC/Mito Auction Houses. Trade items by using the notice board without the hassle of constantly typing in All chat in-game.
- Docking calculator. Calculate the docking parts points without guessing!
- Channel Battle tracker. Have you missed a channel battle and want to know the results without logging into the game? Sure, get DCBuddy to keep you in the know!

# Backend
- Written in C# with the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
- Managed with a PostgreSQL database using the Npgsql API.
- Uses Microsoft Azure to enable Microsoft's ClickOnce deployment for easy patch deployment.

#### Please note that the online capabilities are no longer functional, since I made the decision to end all services with the announcement of Drift City's closure :( ... DCPal's code has not been adjusted enough to run smoothly, but it is not worth altering for a game that no longer exists.
